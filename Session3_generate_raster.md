## Generating raster data from LiDAR (60 min)

This tutorial will cover how to genreate DSM (Digital Surface Model) and NDHM (Normalized Digital Height Model) from the LiDAR data. 

First, you need to move into the *example_data* folder using the command line window. 

### Run Jupyter Notebook

Run a jupyter notebook using below command. 

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

### Hand-on programming using jupyter notebook

We will write codes interactively, but you can also refer to below notebooks if needed.
